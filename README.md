# Module_18_Challenge

The task is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface.


Created a new data class named Record. This class will serve as the blueprint for the financial transaction records that the blocks of the ledger 
will store.

Changed the existing Block data class by replacing the generic data attribute with a record attribute that’s of type Record.

Created additional user input areas in the Streamlit application. These input areas should collect the relevant information for each financial 
record that you’ll store in the PyChain ledger.

Tested the complete PyChain ledger.
